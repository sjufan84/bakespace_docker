Remove unnecessary comments: The comments in the code snippet are not providing any additional information and can be removed to improve code readability.\n\n2. Use string formatting: Instead of concatenating strings using the `+` operator, you can use string formatting to make the code more readable. For example:\n```python\nst.markdown(\"##### Success!

Use list comprehension: Instead of using a loop to create a comma-separated string, you can use list comprehension to create the string in a more concise way. For example:\n```python\nfruits_str = \", \".join([create_link(f) for f in fruits])\nvegetables_str = \", \".join([create_link(v) for v in vegetables])\n```\n\n4.

However, there are a few minor improvements that can be made:\n\n1. Instead of checking if 'kids_data' is in `st.session_state` and then assigning an empty dictionary if it is not present, you can use the `setdefault` method of dictionaries to achieve the same result in a more concise way.\n\n2. Instead of directly accessing `st.session_state.kids_data[st.session_state.kid_name]` to assign the `kids_data` dictionary, you can use the `get` method with a default value to ensure that the key exists in the dictionary.\n\nHere's the updated code snippet:\n\n```python\ndef save_kid_data(favorite_ingredients, least_favorite_ingredients, dietary_restrictions, food_preferences, age, favorite_dishes):\n    kids_data = {\n        'least_favorite_ingredients': least_favorite_ingredients,\n        'favorite_ingredients': favorite_ingredients,\n        'dietary_restrictions': dietary_restrictions,\n        'favorite_dishes': favorite_dishes,\n        'preferences': food_preferences,\n        'age': age, \n        'recipes': {}\n    }\n\n    st.session_state.setdefault('kids_data', {})[st.session_state.kid_name] = kids_data\n```\n\nThis updated code will have the same functionality as the original code but with a slightly more streamlined and efficient implementation."}, {"source": "./streamlined_wireframes/test_repo1\\utils\\get_user_data.py", "rewrite": "def get_new_child_data():\n    st.markdown(f'####  Welcome to your recipe generator, {st.session_state.kid_name}! \ud83d\ude82\ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udf73')\n    st.markdown('---')\n    st.success(f\"Chef Waldo \ud83d\udc69\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc08\u200d\u2b1b:  Let's learn a little bit more about you, and then\\\n                we'll get to the fun part.  **Any text input questions you can answer in natural\\\n               language, no need to give it in any specific format.**\")\n\n    with st.form(key='get_new_child_data_form'):\n        # Favorite ingredients\n        st.markdown(f\"**What are some ingredients that {st.session_state.kid_name} really loves?**\")\n        favorite_ingredients = st.multiselect(\"Select their least favorite ingredients:\", value='')\n        \n        # Dietary restrictions\n        st.markdown(\"**2.
