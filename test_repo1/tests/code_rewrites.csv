./streamlined_wireframes/test_repo1\pages\Get a Pairing.py,"The code snippet can be rewritten to be more streamlined and efficient by using a dictionary to map the session state values to their corresponding functions. This eliminates the need for multiple if-elif statements. Additionally, we can add a check to ensure that the session state variable is valid before calling the corresponding function.

Here's the updated code:

```python
# Mapping of session state values to functions
page_flow = {
    'get_pairing_type': get_pairing_type,
    'display_pairing': display_pairing,
}

# Check if the session state value is valid and call the corresponding function
if st.session_state.pairing_page in page_flow:
    page_flow[st.session_state.pairing_page]()
```

Please note that this code assumes that the functions `get_pairing_type()` and `display_pairing()` are defined elsewhere in the code. Additionally, make sure that the session state variable `pairing_page` is correctly set to either `'get_pairing_type'` or `'display_pairing'` before this code snippet is executed.","# Set the page flow based on the session state

It defines a function `photo_recipe_edit` that takes a `recipe` as input and creates a list of messages. The messages are used to communicate with the OpenAI API and provide instructions for re-formatting the recipe.

To improve the code further, you could consider separating the message content into separate variables for better readability. Here's an example:

```python
def photo_recipe_edit(recipe):
    # Use the OpenAI API to re-format the recipe

    system_message = {
        ""role"": ""system"",

        ""content"" : f""""""Reformat and clean up the following extracted recipe text {recipe}, ensuring that the ingredient names are correct and that the recipe is easy to understand. Please stay as true to the original recipe as possible and,\
        if necessary, infer any parts of the recipe that are unintelligible or don't make sense.  Please reformat it into the following format:\
        \n\nRecipe Name:\n\nIngredients:\n\nAmount of ingredient\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Step 1\n2. Step 2\n3. Step 3\n\nTotal time: (in bold)\n\n\

    }

    messages = [system_message, user_message]
```

This separates the content of each message into its own variable, making it easier to read and understand the purpose of each message.

As for the functionality of the code with the rest of your codebase, it seems to be a standalone function that prepares messages for the OpenAI API.

The code looks fine and should work as intended. It checks the file type of each recipe file and performs the appropriate extraction or processing based on the type. If the `recipe_text_area` is not empty, it uses that as the recipe text. It concatenates all the recipe texts together and returns the result.

Without the implementation details of these functions, it is difficult to provide a streamlined and efficient version of the code snippet. However, I can suggest some general improvements that can make the code more readable and maintainable.

1. Remove unnecessary comments: The comments in the code snippet are not providing any additional information and can be removed to improve code readability.

2. Use string formatting: Instead of concatenating strings using the `+` operator, you can use string formatting to make the code more readable. For example:
```python
st.markdown(""##### Success! Here is a list of produce that is generally in season during the month of {} in {}:  📆🍅🥕🍎"".format(st.session_state.date.strftime(""%B""), st.session_state.location))
```

3. Use list comprehension: Instead of using a loop to create a comma-separated string, you can use list comprehension to create the string in a more concise way. For example:
```python
fruits_str = "", "".join([create_link(f) for f in fruits])
vegetables_str = "", "".join([create_link(v) for v in vegetables])
```

4. Remove unnecessary code: If the code snippet is not being used or referenced elsewhere in the codebase, you can remove it to improve code maintainability.

It is important to note that the functionality of the code snippet depends on the implementation of the functions `find_seasonal_fruits`, `find_seasonal_vegetables`, and `create_link`.

To streamline and improve the efficiency of the code, you can consider the following suggestions:

1. Combine the preference and age sections into a single form submission: Instead of having separate form submission buttons for preferences and age, you can combine them into a single form submission button. This will make the user experience smoother and reduce the number of interactions required.

2. Use default values from `kids_data`: Instead of explicitly setting the default values for `new_preferences` and `new_age` to `kids_data['preferences']` and `kids_data['age']`, respectively, you can directly use these values as the default values in the `st.text_input` and `st.slider` functions.

```python
try:
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-0301"",
        messages=messages,
        max_tokens=1000,
        frequency_penalty=0.5,
        temperature=1,
        n=1,
        presence_penalty=0.5,
    )
    pairing = response.choices[0].message.content
except (requests.exceptions.RequestException, openai.error.APIError):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=""gpt-3.5-turbo-0301"",
        messages=messages,
        max_tokens=1000,

st.session_state['response'] = response
st.session_state.pairing = pairing
st.session_state.pairings_dict[st.session_state.recipe_name] = pairing

return pairing
```

This code handles the exception case by making the same API call with the same parameters. It then assigns the content of the response to the `pairing` variable. The session state variables are updated accordingly, and the `pairing` variable is returned.","except (requests.exceptions.RequestException, openai.error.APIError):

The changes include:
- Importing necessary libraries at the beginning
- Removing the default value for the `title` parameter in the `save_pairing_as_pdf` function to make it more flexible
- Moving the import statements outside of the functions to improve efficiency
- Adjusting the formatting for better readability
